___installation___

 - Put both gonefishing.toc and gonefishing.lua under
   Interface/Addons/gonefishing in your WoW directory.


___basic usage___

 - Create a macro that executes the /gonefishing command.

 - Call the macro to equip everything that raises your fishing
   skill:  rods, boots and hats.  Gone Fishing automatically
   selects your items with the highest fishing stats.
   
 - Call the macro again to unequip your fishing gear and switch
   back to the gear previously worn.

   CAVEAT 1: Gone Fishing uses a fishing rod to track whether you
             want to equip or unequip your fishing gear.  If you
             don't have a fishing rod in your inventory,
             gonefishing can become confused and re-equipping
             your original gear might not work (e.g. if you have
             a fishing hat but no fishing rod).

   CAVEAT 2: Gone Fishing is dumb and does not save your previous
             equipment to disk.  If you log out while wearing
             your fishing gear gonefishing can't switch back to
             your original gear when you log in again.  (In fact
             gonefishing will think your fishing gear is your
             original gear and again become confused.)


___advanced usage___

 - Gone Fishing supports all [conditionals] so you can write a
   macro like this:

   /use [nomod] fishing 
   /gonefishing [mod]

   This will cast your fishing rod if you click the macro
   without any modifiers (shift/ctrl/alt) and it will invoke
   /gonefishing instead only if you hold a modifier.
   This saves space in your action bar.


___updates___

 - Gone Fishing is available at https://github.com/mmitch/gonefishing


___limitations / todos___

 - colorize debug output
 - English documentation
   > add i18n to .toc, README and messages
