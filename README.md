## Basic Usage

1. Create a macro that executes the ```/gonefishing``` command
   and put it in your action bar.

2. Call the macro to equip everything that raises your fishing
   skill:  rods, boots and hats.  Gone Fishing automatically
   selects your items with the highest fishing stats.

3. Catch those fish!
   
4. Call the macro again to unequip your fishing gear and switch
   back to the gear previously worn.

Gone Fishing temporarily uses an equipment set named
```GONEFISHING_tmp``` to store your original gear â€“ so don't edit this
equipment set (you will confuse Gone Fishing) and don't create your
own set with that name (it will be overwritten/deleted).


## Advanced usage

Gone Fishing supports all ```[conditionals]``` so you can write
more complex macros like this:

```
/use [nomod] fishing 
/gonefishing [mod]
```

This will cast your fishing rod if you click the macro
without any modifiers (shift/ctrl/alt) and it will invoke
/gonefishing instead only if you hold a modifier.  
This saves space in your action bar.


## Download / Updates

- Download/Installation via Curse: http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/gonefishing
- Project homepage: https://github.com/mmitch/gonefishing/
- Curseforge Project: http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/gonefishing/


#### Manual installation

Put both ```gonefishing.toc``` and ```gonefishing.lua``` under
```Interface/Addons/gonefishing``` in your WoW directory.


## Limitations

Gone Fishing does not yet know about gloves with fishing skill
enchantments.  I'm working on it.

Gone Fishing is dumb and does not save your previous equipment to
disk.  If you log out while wearing your fishing gear, Gone Fishing
can't switch back to your original gear after you log in again.
(In fact Gonefishing will think your fishing gear is your original
gear and again become confused.)


#### Todo list

- does not take enchantments (eg. gloves) into account
- choose a nice icon for the equipment set
- colorize debug output (unneeded?)
- translate README (don't want to...)
- save stored gear over login/logout.
  check if this could lead to confusion and problems
